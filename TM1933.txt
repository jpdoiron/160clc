Welding 
Repairs 
Safely 


IMPORTANT: 
Disable 
electrical 
power 
before

welding. 
Turn 
off 
main 
battery 
switch 


or 
disconnect 
positive 
battery 
cable. 


Separate 
harness 
connectors 
to 
engine

Avoid 
welding 
or 
heating 
near 
pressurized 
fluid 
lines. 
Flammable 
spray 
may 
result 
and 
cause 
severe 
burns 
if 
pressurized 
lines 
fail 
as 
a 
result 
of 
heating. 
Do 
not 
let 
heat 
go 
beyond 
work 
area 
to 
nearby 
pressurized 
lines. 


Remove 
paint 
properly. 
Do 
not 
inhale 
paint 
dust 
or 
fumes. 
Use 
a 
qualified 
welding 
technician 
for

Avoid 
the 
hazard 
by 
relieving

fluids. 
If 
an 
accident 
occurs, 
see 
a 
doctor 
immediately.
Any 
fluid 
injected 
into 
the 
skin 
must 
be

Make 
sure 
hoses 
are 
not

immediately. 


IMPORTANT: 
Tighten

1. 
Clean 
sealing 
surfaces 
(A). 
Inspect. 
Scratches 
cause 
leaks. 
Roughness 
causes 
seal 
wear. 
Out-of-flat 
causes 
seal 
extrusion. 
If 
defects 
cannot 
be 
polished 
out, 
replace 
component. 
2. 
Install 
the 
correct 
O-ring 
(and 
backup 
washer 
if 
required) 
into 
groove 
using 
petroleum 
jelly 
to 
hold 
it 
in 
place. 
3. 
Split 
flange: 
Loosely 
assemble 
split 
flange 
(B) 
halves. 
Make 
sure 
split 
is 
centrally 
located 
and 
perpendicular 
to 
the 
port. 
Hand 
tighten 
cap 
screws 
to 
hold 
parts 
in 
place. 
Do 
not 
pinch 
O-ring 
(C). 
4. 
Single 
piece 
flange 
(D): 
Place 
hydraulic 
line 
in 
center 
of 
flange 
and 
install 
four 
cap 
screws. 
Flange 
must 
be 
centrally 
located 
on 
port. 
Hand 
tighten 
cap 
screws 
to 
hold 
flange 
in 
place. 
Do 
not 
pinch 
O-ring. 
5. 
After 
components 
are 
properly 
positioned 
and 
cap 
screws 
are 
hand 
tightened, 
tighten 
one 
cap 
screw, 
then 
tighten 
the 
diagonally 
opposite 
cap 
screw. 
Tighten 
two 
remaining 
cap 
screws. 
Tighten 
all 
cap 
screws 
as 
specified 
in 
the 
chart 
below. 
DO 
NOT 
use 
air 
wrenches. 
DO 
NOT 
tighten 
one 
cap 
screw 
fully 
before 
tightening 
the 
others.

IMPORTANT: 
Metal 
face 
seals 
can 
be 
reused 
if 
they 
are 
not 
worn 
or 
damaged. 
A 
used 
seal 
must 
be 
kept 
together 
as 
a 
set 
because 
of 
wear 
patterns 
on 
seal

Keep 
seal 
rings 
together 
as 
a 
matched 
set 
with 
seal 
ring 
faces 
together 
to 
protect 
surfaces. 
5. 
Remove 
axle 
(6). 
Inspect 
axle 
and 
bushing 
for 
scoring 
or 
excessive 
wear. 
NOTE: 
Remove 
bushings 
only 
if 
replacement 
is 
necessary. 


6. 
Remove 
bushing 
using 
a 
2-jaw 
puller 
and 
adapters 
from 
17-1/2 
and 
30-ton 
puller 
set. 
7. 
Replace 
parts 
as 
necessary. 
8. 
Apply 
a 
thin 
film 
of 
oil 
to 
bushings 
(7). 
Install 
bushings 
so 
flange 
is 
tight 
against 
shoulder 
of

9. 
Install 
O-rings 
(5) 
on 
axle. 
10.Apply 
a 
thin 
layer 
of 
NEVER-SEEZ® 
anti-seize 
lubricant 
or 
equivalent 
to 
end 
of

from 
O-ring 
to 
end 
of

O-rings 
and 
seat 
surfaces 
for 
O-rings 
must 
be 
clean, 
dry, 
and 
oilfree 
so 
O-rings 
do 
not 
slip 
when 
idler 
is 
turning. 


13.Thoroughly

may 
be 
used

Cautions

Handling 



CAUTION: 
DO 
NOT 
allow 
liquid 
refrigerant 
to 
contact 
eyes 
or 
skin. 
Liquid 
refrigerant 
will 
freeze 
eyes 
or 
skin 
on 
contact. 
Wear 
goggles,
gloves 
and 
protective 
clothing. 
If 
liquid 
refrigerant 
contacts 
eyes 
or 
skin, 
DO 
NOT 
rub 
the 
area. 
Splash 
large 
amounts 
of 
COOL 
water 
on 
affected 
area. 
Go 
to 
a 
physician 
or 
hospital 
immediately 
for 
treatment. 


DO 
NOT 
allow 
refrigerant 
to 
contact 
openflames 
or 
very 
hot 
surfaces 
such 
as 
electric 
welding 
arc, 
electric 
heating 
element 
andlighted 
smoking 
materials. 


DO 
NOT 
heat 
refrigerant 
over 
52°C 
(125°F) 
in 
a 
closed 
container. 
Heated 
refrigerant 
will 
develophigh 
pressure 
which 
can 
burst 
the 
container. 


Keep 
refrigerant 
containers 
away 
from 
heat 
sources. 
Store 
refrigerant 
in 
a 
cool 
place. 


DO 
NOT 
handle 
damp 
refrigerant 
containerwith 
your 
bare 
hands. 
Skin 
may 
freeze 
to 
container. 
Wear 
gloves. 


If 
skin 
freezes 
to 
container, 
pour 
COOL 
water 
over 
container 
to 
free 
the 
skin. 
Go 
to 
a 
physician 
or 
hospital 
immediately 
for 
treatment. 


IMPORTANT: 
To 
meet 
government 
standards 
relating 
to 
the 
use 
of 
refrigerants, 
R134a 
is 
used 
inthe 
air 
conditioning 
system. 
Because 
it 
does 
not 
contain 
chlorine, 
R134a 
is 
not 
detrimental 
to 
the 
ozone 
in 
the 
atmosphere. 
However, 
it 
is 
illegal 
to 
discharge 
any 
refrigerant 
into 
theatmosphere. 
It 
must 
be 
recovered 
using 
theappropriate 
recovery 
stations. 


Use 
correct 
refrigerant 
recovery, 
recyclingand 
charging 
stations. 
Never 
mix 
refrigerants,
hoses, 
fittings, 
components 
or 
refrigerant 
oils. 


Use 
only 
John 
Deere 
approved 
R134arefrigerant 
products. 
Mixing 
of 
products 
notcompatible 
will 
cause 
system 
damage 
and 
contaminate 
recovery, 
recycling 
and

station 
equipment. 
Care 
must 
be 
taken 
to 
identify 
and 
use 
equipment, 
refrigerant 
oil 
andrefrigerant 
designed 
only 
for 
R134a 
refrigerant 
systems. 
Refrigerant 
should 
be

fortype 
and

before 
recovery, 
recycling 
or

of

IMPORTANT: 
For 
the

Repeat 
procedure 
until 
the

Hydraulic 
Pump 
Start-Up 
Procedure 


IMPORTANT: 
Hydraulic 
pump 
will 
be 
damaged 
if 
notfilled 
with 
oil 
before 
starting 
engine. 
Procedure 
must 
be 
performed 
whenever 
a 
new 
hydraulicpump 
is 
installed 
or 
oil 
has 
been 
drained 
from 
the 
pump 
or 
hydraulic 
oil 
tank. 


Procedure 
is 
to 
ensure 
the 
pumps 
are 
filled 
with 
oil 
and 
air 
is 
bled 
from 
suction 
side 
of 
pumps 
to 
prevent 
cavitation. 


1. 
Perform 
Check 
Hydraulic 
Oil 
Level. 
(Operator's 
Manual.) 
2. 
Remove 
air 
bleed 
plug 
(1) 
from 
the 
top 
of 
pump 
to 
allow 
housing 
to 
fill 
with 
oil 
from 
the 
hydraulic 
tank 
and 
to 
let 
air 
escape. 
3. 
When 
pump 
housing 
is 
full 
of 
oil, 
install 
plug. 
4. 
Check 
oil 
level 
in 
hydraulic 
tank. 
Add 
oil 
as 
necessary. 
Tighten 
hydraulic 
tank 
cap. 
5. 
Start 
engine 
and 
run 
at 
slow 
idle. 
Slowly 
raise 
boom 
to 
full 
height 
and 
then 
lower 
to 
pressurize 
hydraulic 
oil 
tank. 
6. 
Purge 
air 
from 
the 
hydraulic 
system 
by 
slowly 
operating 
each 
function 
through 
three 
cycles. 
Air 
in 
pilot 
circuits 
is 
purged 
automatically.
