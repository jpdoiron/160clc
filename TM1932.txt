Avoid 
welding 
or 
heating 
near 
pressurized 
fluid 
lines. 
Flammable 
spray 
may 
result 
and 
cause 
severe 
burns 
if 
pressurized 
lines 
fail 
as 
a 
result 
of 
heating. 
Do 
not 
let 
heat 
go 
beyond 
work 
area 
to 
nearby 
pressurized 
lines. 


Remove 
paint 
properly. 
Do 
not 
inhale 
paint 
dust 
or 
fumes. 
Use 
a 
qualified 
welding 
technician 
for 
structural 
repairs.

Procedure 


Operational 
Checkout 


Use 
this 
procedure 
to 
check 
operation 
of 
the 
machine. 
It 
is 
designed 
so 
you 
can 
make 
a 
quick 
check 
of 
machine 
operation 
while 
doing 
a 
walk 
around 
inspection 
and 
performing 
specific 
checks 
from 
the 
operator's 
seat. 


If 
there 
is 
a 
problem 
with 
the 
machine, 
helpful 
diagnostic 
information 
in 
this 
checkout 
will 
pinpoint 
the 
cause. 
This 
information 
may 
allow 
you 
to 
perform 
a 
simple 
adjustment 
to 
correct 
the 
problem. 
Use 
the 
table 
of 
contents 
to 
help 
find 
adjustment 
procedures. 


A 
location 
will 
be 
required 
which 
is 
level 
and 
has 
adequate 
space 
to 
complete 
the 
checks. 
No 
tools 
or 
equipment 
are 
needed 
to 
perform 
the 
checkout. 


Complete 
the 
necessary 
visual 
checks 
(oil 
levels, 
oil 
condition, 
external 
leaks, 
loose 
hardware, 
linkage, 
wiring, 
etc.) 
prior 
to 
doing 
the 
checkout. 
The 
machine 
must 
be 
at 
operating 
temperature 
for 
many 
of 
the 
checks. 


Read 
the 
check 
completely 
before 
performing 
it. 
If 
no 
problem 
is 
found, 
you 
will 
be 
instructed 
to 
go 
to 
next

Theory 
of 
Operation 


The 
engine 
speed 
controls 
allows 
the 
operator 
to 
choose 
engine 
speeds 
to 
match 
operating 
conditions 
and 
to 
operate 
the 
engine 
as 
efficiently 
as 
possible. 


Engine 
RPM 
Dial 


The 
function 
of 
engine 
rpm 
dial 
(3) 
is 
to 
control 
the 
engine 
speed 
in 
E 
mode 
(7 
) 
and 
P 
mode 
(8) 
in 
response 
to 
the 
position 
of 
engine 
rpm 
dial. 
Turning 
the 
engine 
rpm 
dial 
to 
change 
engine 
speed 
varies 
the 
voltage 
signal 
sent 
from 
the 
dial 
to 
the 
pump 
and 
valve 
controller. 
The 
controller 
sends 
a 
voltage 
signal 
to 
the 
engine 
control 
unit 
(27). 
Then 
the 
engine 
control 
unit 
regulates 
engine 
speed 
and 
power 
output 
for 
the 
work 
mode 
selected 
via 
the 
voltage 
signals 
from 
the 
pump 
and 
valve 
controller 
and 
from 
sensors 
(28—32) 
located 
on 
the 
engine. 
The 
engine 
control 
unit 
monitors 
engine 
speed 
via 
a 
voltage 
signal 
from 
the 
crankshaft 
sensor 
(32). 
The 
pump 
and 
valve 
controller 
monitors 
engine 
speed 
via 
a 
voltage 
signal 
from 
the 
engine 
speed 
sensor 
(19) 
located 
on 
the 
pump 
drive 
gearbox.

When 
all

(20—24) 
are 
off, 
the 
pump

controller 
decreases 
the 
voltage 
signal 
to 
the 
engine 
control 
unit 
to 
reduce 
the 
engine 
speed 
approximately 
200

HP 
(High 
Power) 
Mode 


The 
function 
of 
HP 
(high 
power) 
mode 
(6) 
is 
to 
increase 
engine 
speed 
when 
a 
little 
more 
hydraulic 
power 
is 
needed 
for 
boom 
up 
and/or 
arm 
in 
operation. 
The 
HP 
mode 
is 
available 
when 
in 
the 
dig 
work 
mode. 


The 
HP 
mode 
is 
actuated 
with 
the 
following 
conditions:

• 
Power 
mode 
switch 
(5) 
is 
turned 
to 
the 
HP

(6) 
position.
• 
Engine 
speed 
is 
approximately 
1500 
rpm 
or 
faster. 
The 
pump 
and 
valve 
controller 
(26) 
receives 
a 
voltage 
signal 
from 
the 
engine

sensor 
(19).

receives 
voltage

from 
the 
pump 
1 
and 
pump 
2 
pressure 
sensors 
(15 
and 
18). 
When 
all 
conditions 
are 
meet, 
the 
pump 
and 
valve 
controller 
sends 
a 
voltage 
signal 
to 
the

The 
engine

unit 
sends 
a 
voltage

to 
the 
injection 
pump 
solenoid 
(33) 
to 
increase 
the 
fuel 
delivery 
thereby 
increasing 
the 
engine 
speed. 
The 
actual

Explanation 
of 
Wire 
Markings 


Electrical 
harness 
wires 
are 
identified 
by 
color, 
with 
no 
number 
stamped 
on 
wire. 
Wire 
numbers 
are 
used 
on 
some 
connector 
drawings 
simply 
as 
reference 
numbers, 
useful 
in 
tracing 
wires 
through 
the 
harness. 


Some 
wires 
are 
solid 
wire 
colors. 
These 
would 
be 
identified 
by 
one 
color 
name 
such 
as 
Red 
or 
Blk 
or 
Grn. 


Other 
wire 
colors 
are 
identified 
with 
two 
color 
names. 
These 
are 
solid 
wires 
with 
a 
narrow 
stripe. 
For 
example, 
a 
wire 
identified 
as 
Red/Wht 
would 
be 
a 
primarily 
Red 
wire, 
with 
a 
Wht 
stripe. 
A 
wire 
identified 
as 
Wht/Red 
would 
be 
a 
primarily 
Wht 
wire 
with 
a 
Red 
stripe. 


Following 
is 
a 
listing 
of 
wire 
color 
abbreviations 
used 
on 
drawings. 


• 
Blk—Black 
•

A 
limited 
number 
of 
wire 
colors 
are 
not 
available 
at 
time 
of 
first 
production. 
In 
those 
cases 
the 
wire 
is 
identified 
by 
a 
number 
only. 
Wire 
color 
will 
be 
added 
as 
soon 
as 
it 
is 
available.

Start 
Circuit 


The 
starting 
circuit 
consists 
of 
batteries 
(G1) 
and 
(G2), 
key 
switch 
(S1), 
starter 
motor 
(M1), 
starter 
relay 
(K13), 
starter 
relay 
diode 
(V4) 
and 
starter 
protection 
relay 
(K10). 


When 
key 
switch 
(S1) 
is 
moved 
to 
the 
START 
position, 
power 
is 
applied 
from 
key 
switch 
terminal 
ST 
to 
terminal 
e 
of 
starter 
relay 
(K13). 
The 
ground 
path 
for 
the 
starter 
relay 
coil 
terminal 
g 
is 
provided 
through 
terminals 
3 
and 
4 
of 
de-energized 
starter 
protection 
relay 
(K10). 
Battery 
power 
from 
fusible 
link 
(F22) 
is 
applied 
from 
terminals 
B 
and 
G 
of 
energized 
starter 
relay 
to 
starter 
(M1) 
solenoid 
terminal 
C, 
energizing 
the 
solenoid. 
This 
applies 
battery 
voltage 
from 
starter 
terminal 
B 
to 
starter 
terminal 
M 
(starter 
motor 
windings), 
causing 
engine 
to 
crank. 


When 
engine 
is 
running 
and 
alternator 
(G3) 
is 
producing 
output 
voltage, 
starter 
protection 
relay 
(K10) 
and 
load 
dump 
rely 
(K1) 
are 
energized 
by 
ground 
applied 
to 
terminal 
2 
from 
pin 
C3 
of 
monitor 
controller 
and 
display 
(A5). 
Starterprotectionrelay(K10)preventstheaccidental 
activation 
of 
starter 
motor 
when 
engine 
is 
running 
by 
removing 
the 
ground 
path 
from 
starter 
relay 
(K13). 


Start 
relay 
diode 
(V4) 
limits 
voltage 
spikes 
generated 
by 
starter 
relay 
coil 
when 
relay 
is 
energized. 


Charging 
Circuit 


The 
charging 
circuit 
consists 
of 
batteries 
(G1) 
and 
(G2), 
key 
switch 
(S1), 
alternator 
(G3), 
alternator 
relay 
(K15), 
load 
dump 
relay 
(K1), 
load 
dump 
relay 
diode 
(V2), 
alternator 
resistor 
(R6) 
and 
monitor 
controller 
and 
display 
(A5). 


With 
key 
switch 
(S1) 
ON, 
battery 
relay 
K14 
is 
energized 
and 
power 
is 
applied 
through 
battery 
relay 
K14 
and 
fusible 
link 
(F22) 
to 
terminal 
B+ 
of 
alternator 
(G3). 
Alternator 
excitation 
power 
is 
provided 
from 
the 
alternator 
B+ 
terminal 
through 
alternator 
resistor 
(R6) 
to 
alternator 


terminal 
D+. 
Excitation 
voltage 
at 
alternator 
W 
terminal 
sends 
+14-24 
volts 
to 
alternator 
relay 
(K15). 
Alternator 
relay 
(K15) 
closes 
and 
24 
volts 
is 
provided 
to 
monitor 
controller 
and 
display 
(A5). 
Alternator 
resistor 
(R6) 
prevents 
the 
alternator 
from 
exciting 
during 
starting. 
Early 
excitation 
would 
cause 
the 
monitor 
controller 
and 
display 
(A5) 
to 
send 
a 
ground 
signal 
to 
starter 
protection 
relay 
(K10), 
removing 
the 
ground 
path 
to 
starter 
relay 
(K13) 
before 
the 
engine 
has 
started. 


With 
engine 
running 
and 
charging 
circuit 
functioning 
properly, 
voltage 
at 
alternator 
terminal 
W 
will 
be 
the 
same 
as 
the 
alternator 
operating 
voltage. 
Therefore, 
alternator 
voltage 
indicator 
light 
(H18) 
and 
monitor 
controller 
and 
display 
alarm 
(H8) 
are 
off. 
Output 
current 
from 
alternator 
B+ 
charges 
batteries 
as 
needed 
and 
provides 
power 
for 
machine 
circuits. 
If 
voltage 
at 
alternator 
terminal 
W 
drops 
below 
the 
alternator 
operating 
voltage 
for 
any 
reason, 
the 
alternator 
relay 
(K15) 
will 
become 
de-energized 
and 
remove 
the 
+24 
volts 
from 
the 
monitor 
controller 
and 
display 
(A5) 
pin 
A2, 
turning 
on 
the 
voltage 
indicator 
light. 
When 
monitor 
controller 
receives 
+24 
volts 
on 
pin 
A2 
from 
alternator 
relay 
(K15), 
the 
monitor 
controller 
and 
display 
grounds 
pin 
C3, 
energizing 
starter 
protection 
relay 
(K10) 
and 
load 
dump 
relay 
(K1). 
With 
load 
dump 
relay 
(K1) 
energized, 
battery 
power 
is 
applied 
through 
contacts 
3 
and 
5 
to 
battery 
relay 
(K14). 
This 
allows 
power 
from 
the 
alternator 
to 
flow 
to 
the 
batteries 
while 
the 
engine 
speed 
slows 
to 
a 
stop 
and 
prevents 
voltage 
spikes. 
Once 
the 
alternator 
slows 
so 
that 
voltage 
at 
the 
W 
terminal 
is 
lower 
than 
battery 
voltage, 
the 
alternator 
relay 
(K15) 
will 
open, 
removing 
the 
ground 
from 
pin 
A2 
of 
the 
monitor 
controller 
and 
display. 
The 
monitor 
controller 
and 
display 
removes 
ground 
from 
the 
load 
dump 
relay 
(K1), 
which 
removes 
power 
to 
the 
battery 
relay. 


Load 
dump 
relay 
diode 
(V2) 
isolates 
battery 
power 
at 
terminal 
5 
of 
load 
dump 
relay 
(K1) 
from 
key 
switch 
ON 
power 
circuits.

The

sensors. 
The 
pump 
and 
valve 
controller 
uses 
the 
high-pressure 
sensors 
(B18 
and 
B19) 
to 
monitor 
the 
delivery 
pressure 
in 
the 
hydraulic 
pumps. 
See 
Pressure 
Sensor 
Test 
for 
more 
information. 
(Group 
9015-25) 


The 
pump 
and 
valve 
controller 
monitors 
the 
engine 
speed 
through 
an 
engine 
speed 
sensor 
(B16) 
mounted 
in 
the 
pump. 
It 
also 
monitors 
engine 
coolant 
temperature 
(B46) 
and 
hydraulic 
oil 
temperature 
(B42). 
The 
pump 
and 
valve 
controller 
cuts 
back 
engine 
power 
if 
the 
coolant 
or 
hydraulic 
oil 
gets 
too 
hot. 


The 
pump 
and 
valve 
controller 
varies 
the 
throttle 
signal 
to 
the 
engine 
based 
on 
the 
engine 
rpm 
dial, 
the 
power 
mode 
selected, 
and 
the 
hydraulic 
function 
being 
actuated.

H/P 
(high

mode 
delivers 
more 
power 
to 
boom-up 
and 
arm-in 
functions 
when 
hydraulic 
pump 
delivery 
pressure 
is 
high. 
The 
pump 
and 
valve 
controller 
controls 
engine 
speed 
through 
a 
throttle 
signal 
voltage 
to 
the 
engine 
control 
unit 
(A2). 
The 
engine 
control 
unit 
monitors 
several 
sensors 
in 
the 
engine 
and 
makes 
adjustments 
to 
maintain 
the 
engine 
speed 
requested 
by 
the 
pump 
and 
valve 
controller. 


Pump 
displacement 
is 
hydraulically 
controlled 
by 
regulators 
located 
on 
the 
pumps. 
As 
the 
controls 
are 
operated, 
the 
increase 
in 
pilot 
pressure 
causes 
the 
regulators 
to 
put 
the 
pumps 
into 
stroke. 
When 
the 
load 
increases, 
high 
pressure 
from 
within 
the 
pumps 
is 
sensed 
by 
the 
regulators 
and 
they 
begin 
to 
take 
the 
pumps 
back 
out 
of 
stroke 
to 
maintain 
an 
engine 
speed 
above 
target 
engine 
speed. 
The 
pump 
and 
valve 
controller 
sets 
the 
target 
engine 
speed 
based 
on 
the 
position 
of 
the 
engine 
rpm 
dial 
(R10), 
power 
mode 
switch 
(S12), 
auto-idle/auto-acceleration 
switch 
(S13), 
and 
the 
state 
of 
the 
pressure 
sensors. 
Target 
engine 
speed 
is 
always 
less 
than 
the 
actual 
engine 
speed 
measured 
by 
the 
engine 
speed 
sensor 
(B16). 
The 
pump 
and 
valve 
controller 
can 
also 
use 
a 
speed 
sense 
solenoid 
(Y6) 
to 
adjust 
a 
pilot 
signal 
to 
the 
regulators 
to 
slightly 
increase 
or 
decrease 
pump 
displacement 
by 
assisting 
the 
high 
pressure 
signal 
from 
within 
the 
pumps. 
As 
actualengine 
speedpulls 
down 
to 
the 
target 
engine 
speed, 
the 
pump 
and 
valve 
controller 
may 
activate 
the 
speed 
sense 
solenoid 
to 
reduce 
the 
load 
on 
the 
engine. 


The 
speed 
sense 
solenoid 
can 
also 
be 
activated 
during 
propel 
functions 
to 
reduce 
machine 
mis-tracking. 
The 


speed 
sense 
solenoid 
is 
a 
proportional 
solenoid, 
and 
under 
most 
conditions, 
is 
always 
activated 
to 
some 
degree. 
During 
a 
propel 
function, 
the 
speed 
sense 
solenoid 
is 
de-activated, 
allowing 
both 
pumps 
to 
go 
to 
maximum 
displacement 
and 
provide 
equal 
flow 
rates 
to 
both 
propel 
motors 
thus 
reducing 
mis-tracking 


A/I 
(Auto-Idle) 
Mode 


A/I 
(Auto-Idle) 
is 
a 
feature 
that 
reduces 
engine 
speed 
when 
hydraulic 
functions 
are 
not 
operated. 
When 
the 
auto-idle/auto-acceleration 
switch 
(S13) 
is 
turned 
to 
A/I 
(auto-idle), 
it 
sends 
a 
ground 
from 
the 
switch 
panel 
(A4) 
to 
the 
monitor 
controller 
and 
display 
(A5) 
to 
illuminate 
the 
auto-idle 
indicator 
and 
to 
the 
pump 
and 
valve 
controller 
(A7) 
pin 
B16. 
When 
the 
engine 
rpm 
dial 
(R10) 
is 
set 
to 
an 
engine 
speed 
above 
auto-idle 
speed, 
the 
pump 
and 
valve 
controller 
will 
reduce 
the 
engine 
speed 
to 
auto-idle 
speed 
if 
hydraulic 
functions 
are 
not 
operated 
for 
more 
that 
4 
seconds. 
If 
engine 
rpm 
dial 
is 
set 
to 
an 
engine 
speed 
below 
auto-idle 
speed, 
the 
engine 
speed 
will 
not 
increase 
or 
decrease 
after 
4 
seconds. 
The 
pump 
and 
valve 
controller 
receives 
the 
pressure 
signal 
from 
the 
dig 
and 
swing 
pressure 
sensor 
(B14) 
in 
the

A/A 
(Auto-Acceleration) 
Mode 


A/A 
(Auto-Acceleration) 
is 
a 
feature 
that 
varies 
engine 
speed 
depending 
on 
hydraulic 
demand. 
When 
the 
auto-idle/auto-acceleration 
switch 
(S13) 
is 
turned 
to 
A/A 
(auto-acceleration), 
auto-idle 
is 
automatically 
turned 
on 
and 
a 
ground 
is 
sent 
from 
the 
switch 
panel 
(A4) 
to 
the 
monitor 
controller 
and 
display 
(A5) 
to 
illuminate 
the 
auto-idle 
andauto-acceleration 
indicators 
andtothe 
pump 
and 
valve 
controller 
(A7) 
pins 
B16 
and 
B12. 
Engine 
speed 
must 
be 
higher 
than 
auto-idle 
speed 
for 
auto-acceleration 
to 
operate. 
Auto-acceleration 
increases 
the 
engine 
speed 
as 
the 
demand 
for 
hydraulics 
increases. 
When 
no 
hydraulic 
functions 
are 
operated, 
or 
pilot 
control 
levers 
are 
in 
the 
neutral 
position, 
the 
engine 
speed 
reduces 
400 
rpm 
immediately, 
and 
then 
reduces 
to 
auto-idle 
speed 
after 
4 
seconds. 
The 
pump 
and 
valve 
controller 
receives 
signals 
from 
the

inside 
the 
cab 
constant. 
The 
controller 
can 
also 
diagnose 
malfunctions 
in 
the 
heater 
or 
air 
conditioner 
system. 


The 
air 
conditioner 
controller 
receives 
switched 
power 
through 
Air 
Conditioner 
and 
Heater 
5 
Amp 
Fuse 
(F7) 
and 
unswitched

(M6). 
The 
blower 
motor 
transistor 
receives 
a 
pulse 
width 
modulated 
signal 
from 
terminal 
8 
of 
the 
air 
conditioner 
controller 
(A3). 
This 
signal 
varies 
in 
proportion 
to 
the

The 
freeze 
control 
sensor 
keeps 
the 
evaporator 
from 
icing 
and 
losing 
efficiency. 


The 
air 
conditioner 
freeze 
control 
sensor 
instructs 
the 
air 
conditioner 
controller 
(A3) 
to 
operate 
the 
air 
conditioner 
compressor 
clutch 
(Y1) 
at 
temperatures

4°C 
(39°F) 
and 
shut 
off 
the 
air 
conditioner 
compressor 
clutch 
at 
temperatures 
below 
3°C 
(37°F). 
The 
air 
conditioner 
freeze 
control 
sensor 
operates 
in 
a 
range 
of 
100 
Ω—115 
kΩ. 


High/Low 
Pressure 
Switch— 
The

pressure 
switch 
(B27) 
prevents 
damage 
to 
the 
air 
conditioner 
compressor 
by 
removing 
power 
from 
the 
air 
conditioner 
compressor 
clutch 
(Y1) 
in 
over 
pressure 
(such 
as 
a 
blocked 
or 
restricted 
line) 
and 
under 
pressure 
events 
(such 
as 
a 
leaking 
or 
empty 
air 
conditioner 
system.) 


The 
high/low 
pressure 
switch 
is 
open 
when 
pressure 
is 
below 
196—225 
kPa 
(1.96—2.25 
bar) 
(28.5—33 
psi) 
or 
when 
pressure 
is 
above 
2550—3140 
kPa 
(25.5—31.4 
bar) 
(371—456 
psi). 
The 
switch 
is 
closed 
when 
the 


pressure 
in 
the 
air 
conditioner 
system 
is 
between 
the 
high 
and 
low 
values. 


Cab 
Air 
Temperature 
Sensor— 
The

(32—77°F) 
from 
the 
recirculated 
air 
inlet. 
The 
cab 
air 
temperature 
sensor 
operates 
in 
the 
range 
of 
300 
Ω—430 
kΩ. 


Ambient 
Air 
Temperature 
Sensor— 
The 
ambient 
air 
temperature 
sensor 
(B45) 
measures 
outside 
air 
temperature. 
The 
ambient 
air

This 
allows 
the 
air 
conditioner 
controller 
(A3) 
to 
adjust 
operating 
conditions 
to 
compensate 
for 
direct 
sunlight 
on 
the

the 
air 
conditioner 
controller 
compares 
the 
voltage 
from 
the 
potentiometer 
to 
the 
desired 
voltage 
for 
the 
new

The 
air 
conditioner 
and 
heater 
mixer 
servomotor 
(M11) 
controls 
the 
opening 
and 
closing 
of 
the 
mix 
door 
and 
the 
air

that 
is 
used 
by 
the 
air 
conditioner 
controller 
(A3) 
to 
determine 
position 
of 
the 
servomotor. 
The 
potentiometer 
has 
5 
V 
delivered 
to 
it 
from

The 
propel 
gearbox 
is 
a 
double 
reduction 
planetary 
drive. 
The 
gearboxes 
are 
interchangeable 
from 
the 
right 
to 
the 
left 
side 
of 
machine. 
The 
output 
drive 
shaft 
(19) 
is 
connected 
to 
the 
input 
drive 
shaft 
(first 
stage 
sun 
gear) 


(7) 
by 
a 
spline 
connection. 
Rotary 
motion 
is 
transferred 
from 
the 
input 
drive 
shaft 
to 
the 
sprocket 
by 
the 
two 
planetary 
gear 
sets 
that 
mesh 
with 
the 
ring 
gear 
(4). 
As 
the 
input 
drive 
shaft 
is 
turned, 
it 
turns 
the 
first 
stage 
planet 
gears 
(6). 
The 
first 
stage 
planet 
gears 
turn 
against 
the 
ring 
gear 
causing 
the 
first 
stage 
carrier 
(10) 
to 
turn. 
The 
first 
stage 
carrier 
is 
connected 
to 
the 
second 
stage 
sun 
gear 
(8) 
that 
is 
in 
mesh 
with 
and 
turns 
the 
second 
stage 
planet 
gears 
(5). 
The 
propel 
motor 
housing 
and 
second 
stage 
carrier 
(1) 
is 
fastened 


to 
the 
track 
frame 
and 
does 
not 
turn 
so 
the 
rotation 
of 
the 
second 
stage 
planet 
gears 
turns 
the 
ring 
gear. 
The 
sprocket 
is 
fastened 
to 
the 
ring 
gear 
which 
drives 
the 
track 
chain 
to 
move 
the 
machine. 


The 
metal 
face 
seals 
(2) 
are 
used 
to 
make 
a 
seal 
between 
the 
propel 
motor 
housing 
and 
second 
stage 
carrier 
which 
is 
stationary 
and 
the 
ring 
gear 
which 
turns 
to 
prevent 
entry 
of 
dirt 
and 
to 
keep 
oil 
in 
the 
gearbox. 
The 
ring 
gear 
is 
supported 
by 
and 
turns 
on 
two 
ball 
bearings 
(3). 
The 
bearing 
nut 
(11) 
holds 
the 
ball 
bearings 
in 
place 
on 
the 
propel 
motor 
housing 
and 
second 
planet 
carrier.

Each 
controller 
contains 
four 
valves 
(2—8), 
one 
for 
each 
dig 
function. 
The 
ports 
(10, 
11, 
and 
12) 
in 
housing 
(9) 
are 
identified 
by 
numbers 
and 
letters 
next 
to 
each 
port. 
The 
valves 
are 
pressure 
reducing 
valves 
controlled 
by 
the 
movement 
of 
the 
control 
lever 
(1) 
and 
plunger

Moving 
the 
control

pushes 
the 
plunger 
and

(3) 
against 
the 
balance

(4) 
which 
moves 
the

flows 
through 
the 
orifice 
(6) 
to 
the 
top 
of 
the 
spool 
to 
dampen 
the 
upward 
movement 
of

increases 
until 
the 
pressure 
is 
equal 
to 
the

pushing 
the 
spool 
up 
until 
the 
oil 
flow 
through 
the 
holes 
is 
blocked 
in 
the 
deadband 
area. 
With 
the 
oil 
flow 
blocked, 
the 
control 
valve 
spool 
is 
held 
stationary 
until 
the 
control 
lever 
is 
again 
actuated 
. 


When 
the 
control 
lever 
is 
actuated 
to 
full 
stroke, 
the 
plunger 
contacts 
the 
spool 
pushing 
it 
down

contacts 
a 
shoulder 
in 
the

to 
the

is 
now 
approximately 
equal 
to 
pilot

pressure. 


When 
the 
control 
lever 
is 
returned 
to 
neutral, 
the 
spool 
is 
pulled 
up 
by 
the 
return

(5) 
and 
pushes 
the 
plunger 
up. 
The

for

(Group 
9025-05.) 


One 
pilot 
controller 
is 
used 
to 
control 
the 
propel 
functions. 
The 
controller 
contains 
four 
valve 
assemblies, 
one 
for 
each 
direction 
of 
propel 
for 
each 
track. 


The 
pilot 
controller 
consists 
of 
the 
cam 
and 
pedal 
(6), 
plunger 
(4), 
sleeve 
(7), 
spring 
guide 
(3), 
spool 
(1), 
balance 
spring 
(8), 
and 
return 
spring 
(9). 


In 
neutral, 
the 
spool 
is 
pushed 
up 
by 
the 
return 
spring 
to 
block 
pilot 
oil 
from 
the 
pilot 
control 
shut-off 
valve 
(11). 
With 
the 
spool 
up, 
the 
passage 
to 
the 
control 
valve 
pilot 
cap 
(12) 
is 
connected 
to 
the 
hydraulic 
oil 
tank 
(10) 
by 
the 
passage 
through 
the 
spool. 


When 
the 
pedal 
is 
pushed 
to 
move 
the 
machine, 
the 
cam 
pushes 
the 
plunger 
and 
spring 
guide 
down 
against 
the 


return 
spring 
and 
balance 
spring. 
The 
balance 
spring 
pushes 
the 
spool 
down. 
As 
the 
spool 
is 
pushed 
down, 
the 
passage 
from 
the 
control 
valve 
pilot 
cap 
to 
the 
hydraulic 
oil 
tank 
is 
closed 
and 
then 
is 
opened 
to 
the 
pilot 
oil 
from 
pilot 
control 
shut-off 
valve. 
When 
the 
pilot 
oil 
pressure 
to 
the 
control 
valve 
pilot 
cap 
is 
equal 
to 
the 
force 
applied 
by 
the 
balance 
spring, 
the 
spool 
moves 
up 
trapping 
the 
oil 
to 
the 
pilot 
cap. 


When 
the 
pedal 
and 
cam 
is 
moved 
to 
full 
stroke, 
the 
plunger 
is 
pushed 
down 
further 
by 
the 
balance 
spring 
opening 
the 
passage 
through 
the 
spool 
more 
to 
the 
pilot 
oil. 
When 
pressure 
to 
the 
control 
valve 
pilot 
cap 
is 
equal 
to 
the 
force 
applied 
by 
the 
balance 
spring, 
the 
spool 
moves 
up 
until 
it 
contacts 
the 
plunger. 
The 
plunger 
holds 
the 
spool 
down 
so 
the 
passage 
through 
spool 
remains 
open 
to 
pilot 
oil. 
Oil 
pressure 
to 
the 
control 
valve 
pilot 
cap 
now 
equals 
pilot 
oil 
pressure.

The

the

The 
hydraulic 
pump 
consists 
of 
three 
pumps; 
hydraulic 
pump 
1, 
hydraulic 
pump 
2, 
and 
pilot 
pump 
(1). 


Hydraulic 
pump 
1 
and 
hydraulic 
pump 
2 
are 
variable 
displacement, 
bent-axis, 
piston 
type 
pumps 
and 
are 
integrated 
in 
one 
housing. 
Pilot 
pump 
(1) 
is 
a 
gear 
pump 
and 
is 
located 
within 
the 
pump 
housing 
(2). 
Hydraulic 
pump 
2 
drive 
shaft 
(20) 
is 
connected 
to 
the 
engine 
flywheel 
through 
a 
dampener 
drive 
(flex 
coupling). 
Hydraulic 
pump 
2, 
hydraulic 
pump 
1, 
and 
pilot 
pump 
are 
driven 
at 
engine 
speed.

(10) 
control 
and

pump 
and 
valve 
operation. 
The 
pumps 
vary 
from 
minimum 
to 
maximum 
displacement 
generating 
the 
supply 
oil 
flow 
in 
the 
hydraulic 
system 
depending 
on 
the 
hydraulic 
demand 
of 
the 
system. 
Pump 
regulators 
(14), 
one 
for 
each 
pump, 
are 
contained 
in 
a 
common 
housing 
attached 
to 
the 
pump 
housing 
(2). 
The 
function 
of 
the 
pump 
regulators 
is 
to 
control 
the 
pump 
flow 
ratesinresponsetosupplyandpilotpressuresignals. 
See

Pump 
Regulator

(Group 
9025-05.) 


The 
cylinder 
block 
(18) 
is 
positioned 
at 
an 
angle 
to 
the 
drive 
shaft. 
As 
the 
cylinder 
block 
and 
drive 
shaft 
rotate, 
pistons 
(13) 
move 
in 
and 
out 
of 
their 
bores 
drawing 
oil 
from 
the 
hydraulic 
oil 
tank 
through 
pump 
inlet 
port 
(6) 
and 
ports 
in 
valve 
plate 
(17). 
Then, 
oil 
is 
pushed 
through 
ports 
in 
the 
valve 
plate 
out 
hydraulic 
pump 
1 
outlet 
port 
(4) 
and 
hydraulic 
pump 
2 
outlet 
port 
(8). 
The 
pump 
displacement, 
or 
flow 
rate, 
is 
varied 
by 
changing 
the 
cylinder 
block 
angle 
with 
respect 
to 
the 
drive 
shaft. 
Increasing 
the 
angle 
increases 
the 
distance 
that 
each 
piston 
travels 
into 
and 
out 
of 
the 
bore 
which 
increases 
displacement. 
Decreasing 
the 
angle 
reduces 
the 
distance 
that 
each 
piston 
travels 
into 
and 
out 
of 
the 
bore 
which 
decreases 
displacement. 
The 
cylinder 
block 
(18) 
is 
connected 
to 
the 
valve 
plate 


(17) 
and 
servo 
piston 
(15) 
by 
swivel 
pin 
(16). 
The 
flow 
of 
pressure 
oil 
to 
the 
large 
chamber 
of 
the 
servo 
piston 
pushes 
the 
piston 
up 
decreasing 
pump 
displacement. 
The 
release 
of 
oil 
from 
the 
large 
chamber 
of 
the 
servo 
piston 
allows 
pressure 
oil 
applied 
to 
the 
small 
chamber 
to 
push 
the 
piston 
down 
increasing 
pump 
displacement.

The 
hydraulic 
pump 
cylinder 
block 
is 
connected 
to 
the 
valve 
plate 
and 
then 
to 
the 
servo 
piston 
(10) 
by 
swivel 
pin 
(13). 
The 
pump 
regulator 
controls 
the

of 
oil 
to 
the 
large

(25) 
of 
the 
servo

The 
remote

in 
each 
regulator 
receives

Oil 
pressure 
to

from 
the 
large

of 
the 
servo 
piston 
controls 
the 
movement 
of 
the

which 
changes 
the 
displacement 
angle 
of 
the

(15) 
and

The 
left

are 
mounted 
back-to-back 
to 
connect 
the

Each

is 
selectively 
fitted 
to 
its 
bore 
in 
the

The

below. 


The 
control 
valve 
is 
an 
open-center

Anti-Cavitation 
Valve 
Operation 


The 
main 
function 
of 
a 
circuit 
relief 
and 
anti-cavitation 
valve 
is 
to 
protect 
the 
components 
of 
a 
work 
circuit 
from 
pressure 
spike 
when 
the 
control 
valve 
spool 
is 
in 
neutral 
and 
to 
provide 
a 
path 
for 
return 
oil 
(14) 
to 
flow 
to 
a 
cylinder 
to 
prevent 
cavitation. 
The 
circuit 
relief 
valve 
is 
pilot-operated 
poppet 
type 
relief 
valve. 
The 
anti-cavitation 
valve 
poppet 
(7) 
also 
functions 
as 
the 
valve 
seat 
for 
the 
main 
poppet 
(4). 
Circuit 
relief 
and 
anti-cavitation 
valves 
are 
used 
in 
the 
bucket, 
boom, 
and 
arm 
work 
circuits. 
The 
circuit 
relief 
valves 
can 
be 
adjusted 
using 
the 
adjusting 
screw 
(1). 


At 
pressures 
below 
the 
circuit 
relief 
valve 
setting 
the 
main 
poppet 
(4) 
is 
seated 
against 
the 
anti-cavitation 
valve 
poppet 
(7). 
The 
anti-cavitation 
valve 
poppet 
is 
held 
against 
the 
main 
poppet 
by 
the 
anti-cavitation 
valve 
spring 
and 
oil 
pressure 
from 
the 
work 
port 
(10). 
Oil 
pressure 
is 
sensed 
on 
the 
end 
of 
pilot 
poppet 
(3) 
through 
the 
orifice 


(6) 
in 
the 
main 
poppet. 
In 
relief 
operation, 
oil 
pressure 
in 
the 
work 
circuit 
exceeds 
the 
pressure 
setting 
of 
the 
pilot 
poppet 
spring 
(2) 
pushing 
the 
pilot 
poppet 
off 
its 
seat. 
The 
oil 
behind 
main 
poppet 
flows 
past 
the 
pilot 
poppet 
and 
through 
the 
drain 
passage 


(12) 
to 
the 
return 
passage 
(11). 
The 
oil 
pressure 
behind 
themainpoppetisreducedcreatingapressuredifferences 
across 
main 
poppet 
because 
oil 
flows 
out 
faster 
than 
oil 
can 
flow 
through 
orifice 
in 
the 
main 
poppet. 
The 
main 
poppet 
is 
pushed 
open 
to 
relieve 
pressure 
oil 
to 
the 
return 
passage. 
The 
anti-cavitation 
valve 
poppet 
bottoms 
against 
a 
shoulder 
and 
does 
not 
follow 
the 
main 
poppet. 
When 
the 
oil 
pressure 
in 
the 
work 
circuit 
decreases 
below 
the 
pressure 
setting, 
the 
pilot 
poppet 
is 
pushed 
closed 
by 
the 
spring 
stopping 
the 
flow 
of 
oil 
past 
the 
pilot 
poppet 
to 
return. 
The 
oil 
pressure 
behind 
the 
main 
poppet 
increases 
pushing 
the 
main 
poppet 
closed 
against 
the 
anti-cavitation 
valve 
poppet. 


During 
anti-cavitation 
operation, 
the 
pressure 
of 
oil 
in 
the 
work 
circuit 
becomes 
less 
than 
the 
pressure 
in 
the 
return 
passage. 
The 
higher 
pressure 
of 
return 
oil 
acts 
on 
the 
conical 
face 
(9) 
of 
anti-cavitation 
valve 
poppet 
pushing 
it

from 
the

During

The

Then,

While

The

is 
applied 
by 
the 
park

springs 
(17) 
whenever 
the 
propel 
function 
is 
in 
neutral 
and 
released 
when

Counterbalance 
valve 
(37) 
is 
used 
for 
smooth 
starts 
and 
stops 
and 
helps 
prevent 
overrunning 
of 
the 
motor 
when 
propelling 
down 
a 
slope. 


Neutral 
Operation: 
When 
the 
propel 
control 
valves 
are 
in 
neutral, 
the 
oil 
in 
the 
motors 
is 
trapped 
by 
the 
check 
valves 
and 
counterbalance 
valve 
holding 
the 
motors 
stationary. 
Both 
work 
ports 
are 
open 
to 
return 
through 
the 
control 
valve 
spools. 
The 
propel 
park 
brake 
piston 
is 
open 
to 
return 
through 
the 
notches 
in 
the 
counterbalance 
valve 
and 
then 
to 
the 
motor 
housing. 


When 
propelling 
down 
a 
hill, 
the 
weight 
of 
the 
machine 
may 
cause 
the 
machine 
to 
overrun 
the 
propel 
motors. 
The 
machine 
would 
propel 
faster 
than 
desired 
and 
cause 
cavitation 
at 
the 
inlet 
side 
of 
the 
motors. 
As 
supply 
oil 
pressure 
decreases 
in 
the 
inlet 
passage 
of 
the 
motor, 
the 
pressure 
holding 
the 
counterbalance 
valve 
spool 
also 
decreases. 
Spring 
(41) 
force 
moves 
the 
counterbalance

Crossover 
relief 
valves 
(45) 
protect 
the 
motor 
circuit 
from 
pressure 
spikes 
and 
surge 
pressures. 


During 
normal 
operation, 
supply 
oil 
from 
the 
control 
valve 
flows 
through 
the 
counterbalance 
spool 
(37), 
past 
the 
check 
valve 
(36) 
and 
through 
the 
valve 
plate 
port 
to 
the 
motor. 
Supply 
oil 
also 
flows 
to 
the 
crossover 
relief 
valves. 
Supply 
oil 
flows 
through 
the 
orifice 
in 
poppet 
(44) 
and 
along 
with 
the 
spring 
(42) 
holds 
the 
poppet 
closed. 
Oil 
is 
also 
routed 
to 
the 
other 
relief 
valve 
to 
help 
hold 
its 
poppet 
closed. 


During 
relief 
operation, 
high 
oil 
pressure 
overcomes 
spring 
force 
and 
moves 
the 
poppet 
off 
its 
seat. 
High 
oil 
pressure 
is 
relieved 
to 
the 
lower 
pressure 
side 
of 
motor 
to 
protect 
the 
motor 
from 
overloading. 
The 
sleeve 
(43) 
on 
crossover 
relief 
valves 
serves 
to 
cushion 
the 
opening 
and 
closing 
of 
the 
poppet. 


In

operation, 
the

Propel 
Operation: 
When 
the 
propel 
function 
is 
actuated, 
supply 
oil 
flows 
from 
the 
propel 
control 
valve 
to 
the 
bottom 
work 
port 
(40) 
for 
forward 
or 
to 
the 
top 
work 
port 
(38) 
for

Return 
oil 
flows 
from 
the 
other 
work 
port 
through 
the 
control 
valve 
to 
the 
hydraulic 
oil 
tank. 


Supply

flows 
into 
the

(37), 
pushingthe

and 
to 
the 
end 
of 
crossover

(45) 
poppet 
(44). 
Supply 
oil 
also 
flows 
through 
the 
orifice 
(35) 
to 
the 
end 
of 
counterbalance 
valve. 
Return 
oil 
from 
the 
opposite 
motor 
port 
is 
blocked 
by 
the 
check 
valve 
and 
counterbalance 
valve. 
This, 
along 
with 
the 
motor's 
resistance 
to 
turning, 
causes 
the 
supply 
oil 
pressure 
to 
increase. 
As 
the 
pressure 
continues 
to 
increase, 
the 
counterbalance 
valve 
is 
pushed 
against 
the 
spring 
(41) 
force. 
As 
valve 
starts 
to 
move, 
supply 
oil 
flows 
through 
notches 
in 
the 
valve 
to 
propel 
park 
brake 
piston 


(39) 
releasing 
the 
park 
brake. 
As 
the 
valve 
continues 
to 
move, 
return 
oil 
flows 
through 
notches 
in 
the 
valve 
to 
the 
work 
port 
and 
the 
propel 
motors 
start 
to 
turn. 
When 
the 
propel 
function 
is 
returned 
to 
neutral, 
the 
flow 
of 
supply 
oil 
is 
stopped 
and 
both 
work 
ports 
are 
open 
to 
return 
through 
the 
control 
valve. 
The 
check 
valve 
closes 
and 
counterbalance 
valve 
is 
centered 
by 
the 
spring 
trapping 
oil 
in 
the 
motor 
stopping 
it 
from 
turning. 


Oil 
in 
propel 
park 
brake 
circuit 
is 
released 
through 
a 
notch 
in 
the 
counterbalance 
valve 
to 
return 
as 
the 
springs 
pushes 
the 
piston 
to 
engage 
the 
park 
brake. 


The 
pressure 
spike 
caused 
by 
the 
inertia 
of 
machine 
on 
the 
motor 
is 
released 
to 
the

side 
of

by 
the

IMPORTANT: 
For 
the 
most 
effective 
results, 
cleaning 
procedure 
must 
start 
with 
the 
smallest 
capacity 
circuit 
then 
proceed 
to 
the 
next 
larger 
capacity 
circuit. 


6. 
Starting 
with 
the 
smallest 
capacity 
circuit, 
operate 
each 
function 
through 
a 
complete 
cycle. 
Repeat 
procedure 
until 
the 
total 
system 
capacity 
has 
circulated 
through 
filter 
caddy 
seven 
times. 
Each 
function 
must 
go 
through 
a 
minimum 
of 
three 
complete 
cycles 
for 
a 
thorough 
cleaning 
of 
oil.
